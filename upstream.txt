Q: Explain what the "upstream" remote is usually used for, in your own words. 

A: "upstream" is to pull/copy files from someone else's remote depository to a local depositary. ie if you are a 'fork user' of that remote depositoary.  It is also helpful to keep an track of any changes made from the files on the other remote depository.
